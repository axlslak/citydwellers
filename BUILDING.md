# Building City Dwellers

## Requirements

- Visual Studio 2022 with the **.NET desktop development** workload
- The .NET Framework 4.8 targeting pack
- NuGet package restore enabled (the Visual Studio default)

The repository can be cloned into any directory. It does not require a separate
AOSharp or AOSharp.Clientless source checkout.

## Build

Open `citydwellers.sln`, select the `Release` configuration, and build the
solution. Visual Studio restores the pinned dependencies from NuGet before it
compiles the projects. Output is written to `bin\Release`.

From a Visual Studio Developer PowerShell, the equivalent command is:

```powershell
msbuild citydwellers.sln -restore -property:Configuration=Release
```

If automatic restore has been disabled, right-click the solution and select
**Restore NuGet Packages** before building.

Dependency versions are maintained once for all six projects in
`Directory.Build.props`. Restored packages live in the developer's global NuGet
cache rather than in this repository or at a hard-coded filesystem path.
